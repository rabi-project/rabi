## Field semantics (selected, normative)

**`spec.workload`** — exactly one modality payload, matching `kind`. Unknown `kind` values MUST be
rejected at admission (not at placement). New modalities are additive spec changes via RFC.

**`spec.scheduling.onConflict`** (RFC-0003) — resolves declared-intent conflicts between a
quality floor and a deadline when both cannot be satisfied. `prefer-quality` (default; may
wait past the deadline; condition `DeadlineExceededWaitingForQuality` recorded when it
passes) · `prefer-deadline` (at the decision horizon, bind best-ESP ignoring floors;
`status.placement.floorsRelaxed: true` with violated floors and actual values — never a
silent violation) · `reject` (at the horizon, `FAILED` with `CAPABILITY_MISMATCH`,
`retriable: true`, condition `UnsatisfiableBeforeDeadline`). The placement audit MUST name
the mode in effect. Sessions inherit the opening job's setting.

**`spec.requirements.quality`** — constraints are *floors/ceilings evaluated against a specific
calibration snapshot at placement time*; the snapshot ID MUST be recorded in `status.placement`.
A job with no feasible target stays `PENDING` with a condition explaining which constraint failed
for how many targets. Floors are evaluated under an **aggregate** (RFC-0002): the default
`best` takes the most favorable metric value in the snapshot (minimum for error metrics)
— a device is feasible when at least one qubit/edge/readout region satisfies the floor,
since transpilation steers toward the good region. `aggregate: best | median | worst` may
be set per modality block. Rejection reasons and placement audits MUST state the aggregate
used and the winning value. Quality keys are namespaced per modality; provider-specific extensions live
under `quality.extensions.<vendor>` and never participate in cross-vendor comparison.

**`spec.coupling`** — declares the latency class the workload needs; `real-time` jobs can only bind
to Targets whose adapters declare a real-time capability (e.g., NVQLink-class integration). Tangle
allocates such bundles; it never sits in their latency path.

**`spec.budget.limits`** — native-unit caps enforced by the adapter where the vendor supports it,
and by the control plane as accounting cutoffs otherwise. `maxCost` is evaluated by the accounting
layer's normalization policy and is advisory at placement, binding at settlement.

**`spec.backendSelector`** — narrows the feasible set; it cannot widen quality or budget
constraints. `denyTargets`/`allowCloudBurst` take Target names; globbing is implementation-defined.

**`status.placement`** — the audit trail. Every binding records policy id/version, snapshot id,
predictions, and a human-readable reason. This field is what makes scheduling *arguable* — sites
can reconstruct why any job landed where it did.

## Validation (admission-time, normative)

1. `workload.kind` known; payload present and matching.
2. `program.format` ∈ declared formats of at least one registered adapter (warning, not rejection,
   if fleet currently lacks it — the fleet may change).
3. `deadline`, if set, is in the future; `session.maxDuration ≤ tenant policy max`.
4. `budget.limits` keys are known native units.
5. Tenant exists and has quota headroom for admission (execution-time quota is re-checked at bind).
